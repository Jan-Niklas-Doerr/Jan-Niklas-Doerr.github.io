Student Assistant for the "Applied Discrete Optimization" Lecture at the Technical University Munich

Course Description
======
Discrete optimization problems arise in many practical applications and functional areas. This course focuses on the underlying polyhedral theory and both exact and heuristic solution methods that make it possible to solve the large-scale and complex models. Topics include review of linear programming and its methods, the integer programming model formulation, computational complexity, cutting plane methods, branch and bound and its variations, Lagrangian duality, decompositions, and heuristic methods. This course is suitable for a Master student in an advanced level.
